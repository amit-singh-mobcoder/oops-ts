# Object-Oriented Programming in TypeScript
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

## Introduction

This project serves as a comprehensive guide to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using TypeScript. It covers the fundamental concepts of OOP, including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, with practical examples and explanations.

## Key Concepts

### Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts of an object. In TypeScript, this is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class. This principle helps in hiding the internal state of an object and only exposing a controlled interface to the outside world. In TypeScript, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers such as public, private, and protected.

### Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows one class (the child or subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (the parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. In TypeScript, inheritance is implemented using the extends keyword.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism is another key principle of OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). In TypeScript, polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and interfaces.
